# YinYogaTimer
Yin is a style of yoga where postures are held for several minutes at a time. Thus, it can be easy for a yogi to lose track of how long they've been in a pose. YinYogaTimer is designed to take input from the user in the form of a list of posture durations. Using these timings, the program creates a yoga sequence interspersed with helpful chimes, doing away with the need to focus on anything but the current posture during practice. 
## How Does the Program Work?
The user will be prompted to input a list of posture durations from their desired sequence. Three chimes mark the beginning of the practice. During the sequence, one chime indicates the start of a pose, and two chimes the end of a pose. There is a thirty second transition period between each posture, so the yogi can be slow and mindful moving from one pose to the next. As a constant of every yoga practice, the final pose, shavasana, begins with one chime and is terminated by three chimes indicating the end of the practice.
## Using the Program
Separate duration times with a comma and a space (e.g. 1, 2, 3 not 1,2,3) when entering. Sequence durations are printed in a list before the start of the practice, so the user can double check input. If a mistake has been made, restart the program. YinYogaTimer will request that the user hit enter before running the timed sequence.
