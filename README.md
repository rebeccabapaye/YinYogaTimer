# YinYogaTimer
Yin is a style of yoga where postures are held for several minutes at a time. Thus, it can be easy to lose track of how long you've been in a pose. YinYogaTimer is designed to take a list of posture durations inputted by the user and form a sequence interspersed with helpful chimes, doing away with the need to focus on anything but the posture during practice. One chime indicates the beginning of a pose, and two chimes indicates the end of a pose. There is a thirty second transition period between each posture, so the user can be slow and mindful moving from one pose to the next. As a constant of every yoga practice, the final pose, shavasana, begins with one chime and is terminated by three chimes indicating the end of the practice.
## Using the Program
When entering duration times, seperate them with a comma and a space (e.g. 1, 2, 3 not 1,2,3). The program will request that the user hit enter before running the timed seqeunce. Three chimes indicate the beginning and end of the practice. Sequence times are printed in a list before the start of the practice, so the user can double check input. If a mistake has been made, restart the program.
